# Color Memory & Descrimination Test

This small project tests your short term color memory and the ability to descriminate between slight variations in color shades. A color is presented, occluded, and then presented again. During the second presentation the color's hue will, half of the time, be altered to a different value. The differences are minute. Your task is to tell whether it's the same color or different and to indicate how confident you are in your judgment. The results update 4 data visualizations in real-time.
